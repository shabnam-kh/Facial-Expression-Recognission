# Facial-Expression-Recognission
investigate the problem domain of Facial Expression
Recognition (FER) in real-life environments, i.e., in-the-wild and demonstrate your
understanding on data preparation and pre-processing tasks when developing machine
learning approaches for FER.
The dataset needed for this assignment can be downloaded from here. The provided
dataset has been artificially generated from the Aff-Wild2 database [1-10] using the
methods [11-14]. Some (real) images of Aff-Wild2 database have been selected and
used in a facial expression manipulation-transfer setting so as to create the provided
artificially generated dataset. All images in the provided dataset are annotated in terms of
the 6 basic expressions (i.e., happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, sadness, anger) [15].
